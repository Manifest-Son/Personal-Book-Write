Reject all the notions that are against what God has created and kept it for us as good.
In Genesis as God was creating, he said it was good.
We should get back into seeing that everything that God created is good and worthy of acceptance. Nothing is from the devil. The devil owns nothing.
He just corrupts.
The creation is eagerly waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. God gave us dominion. That same dominion is restored back to us. We should start working out/ exercising that dominion by dominating over the earth and making the glory of God be seen.
It would be nice to see a whole company full of believers and all are working seamlessly to change their environment and this brings glory to God.
Let's not fall into deception but take hold of the truth and run with it.
My final remarks on this is:
Everything God created was and is good. Through the death of Christ he glorified man and the things under man that His glory might be mentioned in the heavenly places for the devil and his demons to know that God is supreme.
Man has the responsibility, I have the responsibility.
The responsibility is to let the goodness of God be seen in me and through me.
